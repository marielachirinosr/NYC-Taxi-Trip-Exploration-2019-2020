# NYC Taxi Insights: Analyzing Q1 Trends (2019-2020)

This project focuses on analyzing various aspects of taxi transportation in New York City (NYC) during the first quarter (Q1) of 2019 and 2020. Leveraging publicly available data, we delve into key metrics such as trip distance, passenger count, fare amounts, tipping behavior, and congestion surcharges to gain insights into the dynamics of NYC's taxi industry.

Through data visualization, statistical analysis, and trend comparison, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and potential correlations within the NYC taxi dataset. By understanding these nuances, we can draw valuable conclusions about the impact of external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on taxi operations, customer behavior, and transportation infrastructure in NYC.
